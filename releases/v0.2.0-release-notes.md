# yume v0.2.0

## Overview

This release improves the macOS installation process with enhanced .pkg installers that resolve application relocation issues encountered in previous versions.

## Changes

### macOS Installation

The macOS installers now use component-based packaging (`--component` mode) to ensure the application installs to a fixed location. This prevents relocation during installation and resolves the "damaged application" errors that occurred when the system attempted to move the app bundle.

**Improvements:**
- Component-based .pkg installation prevents relocation issues
- Automatic quarantine attribute removal
- Consistent installation location across systems

## Installation

### macOS
- **Apple Silicon**: `yume_0.2.0_arm64.pkg`
- **Intel**: `yume_0.2.0_x64.pkg`

Download and run the installer. The package automatically handles code signing and quarantine attribute removal.

### Windows
- **x64**: `yume_0.2.0_x64-setup.exe`

Download and execute the installer. Administrative privileges may be required.

## System Requirements

- **macOS**: 10.13 or later (Apple Silicon and Intel)
- **Windows**: 10/11 (x64)
- **Dependencies**: Claude CLI configured with valid credentials
