## 🔧 Critical Font Fix for Windows

This release fixes a critical bug where the Agave font was not loading on Windows systems that didn't have Agave installed system-wide. Windows users were seeing fallback system fonts instead of the intended Agave monospace font.

### What's Fixed

**Font Embedding for Windows**
- ✅ Agave font now properly embedded and loads on all Windows systems
- ✅ Replaced dynamic font loading with static CSS imports for better cross-platform compatibility
- ✅ Uses absolute `/fonts/` paths that work correctly in both development and production builds
- ✅ No longer requires Agave to be installed system-wide

### Technical Details

**Before (0.2.1 and earlier):**
- Used `convertFileSrc` API for dynamic font injection
- Worked on macOS but failed on Windows
- Required manual font installation on Windows

**After (0.2.2):**
- Static CSS import of embedded fonts
- Fonts bundled directly in the app assets
- Works out-of-the-box on all platforms
