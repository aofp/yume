# yume v0.2.2

## Overview

This release resolves a cross-platform font rendering issue that affected Windows installations. The Agave monospace font is now properly embedded in all platform distributions, ensuring consistent typography across macOS and Windows systems.

## Changes

### Font Embedding

Resolved an issue where the Agave typeface failed to load on Windows systems without a system-wide font installation. The font assets are now statically bundled within the application, eliminating external dependencies and ensuring consistent rendering across all supported platforms.

**Impact:**
- Windows users no longer require manual font installation
- Improved cross-platform consistency
- Simplified deployment and distribution
