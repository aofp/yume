# yume v0.2.3

## fixes

- **5h/7d rate limit bars** - now show cached values instantly on startup instead of 0% until async fetch completes
- **context limit bug** - from previous commits

## what's changed

the 5h/7d rate limit indicator bars in the context bar would previously show 0% on app startup until the async API call completed. this was jarring especially after opening the stats modal (which forced a refresh and then showed correct values). now the bars load cached data synchronously on first render.
