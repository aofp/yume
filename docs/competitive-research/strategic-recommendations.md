## Prioritized Action Plan

### ✅ DONE: Everything Critical

1. ✅ Native rendering (no flicker/lag)
2. ✅ 32+ keyboard shortcuts

### ⬜ Remaining (4 days of work)

#### 1. Light Mode
- **Effort**: LOW (1 day)
- **Impact**: MEDIUM (accessibility)
- **Why**: Theme infrastructure exists (30 themes). Just add light variants.

#### 2. Command Palette

## Strategic Positioning

### What Yume IS

> **The native desktop experience for Claude Code CLI**

- Solves terminal flicker (GitHub #1913)
- Full Claude ecosystem support
- One-time purchase ($21)
- Privacy-focused (no telemetry)
- 12+ unique features

### What Yume is NOT

- A full IDE (let Claude Code handle it)
- A Cursor competitor (different market)
- An enterprise platform (wrong focus)

### Messaging

**Tagline options:**
- "Claude Code, Unchained"
- "The GUI Claude Code Deserves"
- "All the Power, None of the Lag"

**Key points:**
1. Solves the #1 Claude Code complaint (flicker)
2. $21 one-time vs $20-200/mo subscriptions
3. Native Rust performance
4. 12+ unique features (5h/7d limits, agents, guard, etc.)

## Competitive Intelligence

### Cursor ($29.3B)
- **Threat level**: Low (different market segment)
- **Weaknesses**: Performance issues, expensive, subscription fatigue
- **We win on**: Native performance, $21 one-time, no telemetry

### Windsurf
- **Threat level**: Low (corporate chaos, different segment)
- **Weaknesses**: Beta feel, files >300 lines struggle
- **We win on**: Stability, features, pricing

### Opcode (YC-backed, Free) - 15K+ Stars
- **Threat level**: MEDIUM (direct competitor)
- **Their advantages**: Free, session forking, 15K+ GitHub community
- **We win on**:
  - 5h/7d limit tracking (they don't have)
  - Yume Guard (they don't have)
  - 5 built-in agents (they don't have)
  - 30 themes (they have 0)
  - 9 hook events (they have 0)
  - Crash recovery (they don't have)
  - @ mention system (they don't have)
  - Stream timers (they don't have)
  - 32+ keyboard shortcuts (they don't have)

### Claude Desktop (Anthropic)
- **Threat level**: MEDIUM
- **Risk**: Anthropic releases official Claude Code GUI
- **Mitigation**: Stay complementary, offer unique features

## Metrics for Success

### "100% Best" Criteria

1. **Performance**: <50ms input latency ✅
2. **Stability**: Zero crashes, zero flicker ✅
3. **Feature parity**: Everything CLI can do + visual enhancements ✅
4. **Unique value**: 12+ features no competitor has ✅

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Anthropic releases official GUI | MEDIUM | HIGH | 12+ unique features they won't have |
| Claude Code CLI fixes flicker | LOW | MEDIUM | We have way more than "no flicker" now |
| Opcode adds our features | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Keep innovating, they're behind |
| Cursor dominance continues | HIGH | LOW | Different market segment |

## Conclusion

Yume is **definitively the best Claude Code UI** as of January 2026.

### Completed (Unique Advantages)
- ✅ 12+ unique features no competitor has
- ✅ Native performance (no flicker)
- ✅ $21 one-time pricing

### Remaining Items (4 days)
1. **Light mode** - 1 day
2. **Command palette** - 2-3 days

### Final Assessment

**Bottom line**: Yume has MORE unique features than any competitor. Even Opcode (our direct competitor) is missing: 5h/7d tracking, Yume Guard, built-in agents, themes, hooks, crash recovery, @ mentions, stream timers, and keyboard shortcuts.

Focus on:
1. Marketing the unique advantages
2. Light mode and command palette as polish
