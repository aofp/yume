# Marketing & Positioning Strategy

*How to position yurucode in the AI coding tools market*

## Market Context

### Developer AI Adoption
- 85% regularly use AI tools
- 62% use at least one coding assistant
- 92% use some AI tool (any type)

### Trust Landscape
- Stack Overflow: Favorable views dropped from 70% → 60%
- Only 29% rely on AI output (down from 40%)
- 46% don't trust AI accuracy

### Key Insight
> "Positioning AI as a tool that enhances, rather than replaces, developers resonates strongly"

## Competitive Positioning

### Current Landscape

| Position | Occupants | Yurucode Opportunity |
|----------|-----------|---------------------|
| "AI IDE" | Cursor, Windsurf | Not competing here |
| "Terminal AI" | Claude Code CLI, Aider | Direct competition |
| "IDE Plugin" | Copilot, Continue, Cline | Not competing here |
| "Claude Desktop GUI" | **Nobody** | **Open position** |

### Yurucode's Unique Position

```
"Claude Code, without the lag"
```

We're not:
- Another IDE (Cursor already won)
- A general AI tool (ChatGPT dominates)
- An IDE plugin (crowded market)

We are:
- The desktop experience for Claude Code
- Solving the TUI problem specifically
- For Claude loyalists who hate terminal issues
