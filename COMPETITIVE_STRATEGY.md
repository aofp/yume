# yurucode competitive strategy

## market position: "the anti-cursor"

where cursor is $192/year subscription bloat, yurucode is $10 one-time + claude api
where windsurf promises "flow state" through features, we deliver it through absence

## pricing model: freemium done right

### trial version (free)
- **1 session limit**: can only run one claude session at a time
- **full features**: everything else identical to paid version
- **no time limit**: use forever with single session restriction
- **perfect for**: trying it out, simple scripts, learning claude

### full version ($10 one-time)
- **unlimited sessions**: run multiple claude sessions in tabs
- **lifetime license**: pay once, use forever
- **no subscriptions**: ever
- **perfect for**: professionals, multi-project work, power users

## our moat: radical minimalism

### 1. realistic performance metrics
- **startup time**: <1s (cursor: 3-5s, windsurf: 2-3s)
- **memory usage**: ~200mb (cursor: 500mb+, vscode: 400mb+)
- **oled battery savings**: 15-20% less power than dark gray themes
- **zero telemetry**: no analytics, no tracking, no bullshit

### 2. features we deliberately DON'T have (and why that's good)
- no ai autocomplete (distracting, breaks flow)
- no project generation (claude code does this better)
- no collaboration (use git like an adult)
- no cloud sync (privacy nightmare)
- no subscription (pay claude directly)

### 3. features only we have
- **true black #000000** - only oled-optimized ai ide
- **tab isolation** - work on 10 projects without context pollution
- **instant clear** - ctrl+l nuclear option when claude gets confused
- **no pointer cursors** - everything cursor:default (unique aesthetic)
- **lowercase only** - anti-corporate design statement

## target users (our tribe)

### primary: "terminal refugees"
- love aider's efficiency, hate terminal ui limitations
- want gui for copy/paste and visual feedback
- typical: senior engineer, uses vim, has opinions about systemd

### secondary: "subscription exhausted"
- paying for cursor + copilot + chatgpt + claude = $60+/month
- want one tool, one api, no middleman
- typical: indie developer, bootstrapped startup

### tertiary: "oled enthusiasts"
- bought $3000 oled laptop, wants true black everything
- cares about battery life and pixel burn-in
- typical: macbook pro user, works from cafes

## growth strategy (realistic timeline)

### phase 1: soft launch & feedback (months 1-3)
- **goal**: 100 active users, iron out bugs
- **channels**: 
  - personal network & twitter
  - r/claudeai for early adopters
  - small discord/slack communities
- **focus**: stability over features

### phase 2: reddit organic growth (months 3-6)
- **goal**: 1,000 users, first $1,000 in sales
- **target subreddits** (comment, don't spam):
  - r/neovim - "lightweight gui for claude code"
  - r/programming - weekend show-off threads
  - r/webdev - tool tuesday posts
- **realistic message**: "built a simple claude gui, $10 if you want tabs"

### phase 3: sustainable growth (months 6-12)
- **goal**: 5,000 users, $10,000 total revenue
- **channels**:
  - github organic (aim for 1k stars, not 10k)
  - small youtube channels (not primagen)
  - product hunt launch (once stable)
- **focus**: word of mouth from happy users

## competitive responses (realistic)

### cursor/windsurf will:
- ignore us completely (we're too small to matter)
- if we get traction: dismiss as "toy" or "hobby project"
- continue adding features for enterprise customers

### claude.ai will:
- keep improving web ui (our local file access remains advantage)
- maybe release official desktop app (we'll need to differentiate more)

### new entrants will:
- dozens of similar minimal clients will appear
- most will be abandoned after 2 months
- our consistency and $10 price point keeps us relevant

## metrics that matter

### vanity metrics (ignore):
- total downloads (meaningless without retention)
- feature count (less is more)
- funding raised ($0 is our flex)

### real metrics (track):
- **conversion rate**: free → paid (target: 5-10%)
- **monthly active users**: better than total downloads
- **support tickets**: must stay manageable (<10/week)
- **refund rate**: must stay low (<2%)
- **actual revenue**: the only number that matters

## positioning statements

### elevator pitch
"cursor charges $192/year. we charge $10 once. both just wrap claude, but ours actually starts fast."

### twitter bio
"minimal claude gui. $10 for unlimited tabs. that's it."

### reddit comment
"built a simple electron wrapper for claude cli. free for single session, $10 if you want tabs. no subscription bs."

## competitive advantages summary

| aspect | cursor | windsurf | aider | yurucode |
|--------|--------|----------|-------|----------|
| price | $192/yr | $180/yr | free | free/$10 |
| memory | 500mb+ | 400mb+ | 20mb | ~200mb |
| startup | 3-5s | 2-3s | instant | <1s |
| theme | dark gray | dark gray | terminal | true black |
| local | no | no | yes | yes |
| tabs | yes | yes | no | yes (paid) |
| business model | subscription | subscription | donations | one-time |

## realistic endgame

### success looks like:
- **year 1**: 5,000 users, $10k revenue, sustainable side project
- **year 2**: 20,000 users, $50k revenue, covers hosting + time
- **year 3**: 50,000 users, $150k revenue, viable business

### what we're NOT trying to do:
- beat cursor (impossible, they have vc money)
- become a unicorn (we're a $10 app)
- support enterprise (nightmare)

### sustainable niche:
we're the honda civic of ai ides. not fancy, not expensive, but reliable and gets the job done. there will always be developers who just want a simple, fast, one-time-purchase tool.

### exit strategy:
- **best case**: sustainable lifestyle business generating $100k+/year
- **realistic case**: nice side income while working day job
- **worst case**: learned electron, shipped product, moved on

the goal isn't to win the ai ide wars. it's to build something useful, charge a fair price, and serve a specific audience well. 

when cursor raises another $100m and windsurf adds ai-powered coffee ordering, we'll still be here: simple, fast, $10.

that's enough.
