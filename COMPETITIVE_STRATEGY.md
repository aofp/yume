# yurucode competitive strategy

## market position: "the anti-cursor"

where cursor is $192/year subscription bloat, yurucode is $0 + claude api
where windsurf promises "flow state" through features, we deliver it through absence

## our moat: radical minimalism

### 1. performance metrics to crush competitors
- **startup time**: <100ms (cursor: 3-5s, windsurf: 2-3s)
- **memory usage**: <50mb (cursor: 500mb+, vscode: 400mb+)
- **oled battery savings**: 40% less power than dark gray themes
- **zero telemetry**: no analytics, no tracking, no bullshit

### 2. features we deliberately DON'T have (and why that's good)
- no ai autocomplete (distracting, breaks flow)
- no project generation (claude code does this better)
- no collaboration (use git like an adult)
- no cloud sync (privacy nightmare)
- no subscription (pay claude directly)

### 3. features only we have
- **true black #000000** - only oled-optimized ai ide
- **tab isolation** - work on 10 projects without context pollution
- **instant clear** - ctrl+l nuclear option when claude gets confused
- **no pointer cursors** - everything cursor:default (unique aesthetic)
- **lowercase only** - anti-corporate design statement

## target users (our tribe)

### primary: "terminal refugees"
- love aider's efficiency, hate terminal ui limitations
- want gui for copy/paste and visual feedback
- typical: senior engineer, uses vim, has opinions about systemd

### secondary: "subscription exhausted"
- paying for cursor + copilot + chatgpt + claude = $60+/month
- want one tool, one api, no middleman
- typical: indie developer, bootstrapped startup

### tertiary: "oled enthusiasts"
- bought $3000 oled laptop, wants true black everything
- cares about battery life and pixel burn-in
- typical: macbook pro user, works from cafes

## growth strategy

### phase 1: reddit dominance (months 1-3)
target subreddits:
- r/neovim - "gui for claude code that doesn't suck"
- r/unixporn - screenshots of oled black beauty
- r/programming - "i replaced cursor with 50mb electron app"
- r/selfhosted - "run claude locally, no cloud bs"

### phase 2: influencer capture (months 3-6)
target creators:
- primagen - appeal to performance obsession
- fireship - "i tried every ai ide, this one is different"
- theo (t3) - anti-subscription message resonates

### phase 3: github stars arms race (months 6-12)
- goal: 10k stars faster than claudia (took 2 months)
- tactics: 
  - "awesome" lists placement
  - comparison tables showing memory/performance
  - gif demos of instant startup

## competitive responses we expect

### cursor/windsurf will:
- add "minimal mode" (won't work, too bloated at core)
- reduce prices (irrelevant, we're free)
- add more features (makes them slower, helps us)

### claude.ai will:
- improve web ui (can't access local files, permanent advantage)
- release official desktop app (likely electron bloat)

### new entrants will:
- copy our aesthetic (we'll already own mindshare)
- try "even more minimal" (nothing left to remove)

## metrics that matter

### vanity metrics (ignore):
- total users (quality > quantity)
- feature count (less is more)
- funding raised ($0 is our flex)

### real metrics (obsess):
- startup time (must stay <100ms)
- memory usage (must stay <50mb)
- github stars (social proof)
- reddit mentions (organic growth)
- session length (flow state indicator)

## positioning statements

### elevator pitch
"cursor charges $192/year to wrap claude in bloat. we give you claude in 50mb for free."

### twitter bio
"the 50mb ai ide. oled black. zero subscriptions. just claude."

### reddit comment
"tried cursor (too heavy), windsurf (too complex), aider (no gui). built this instead: [link]"

## competitive advantages summary

| aspect | cursor | windsurf | aider | yurucode |
|--------|--------|----------|-------|----------|
| price | $192/yr | $180/yr | free | free |
| memory | 500mb+ | 400mb+ | 20mb | 50mb |
| startup | 3-5s | 2-3s | instant | <100ms |
| theme | dark gray | dark gray | terminal | true black |
| local | no | no | yes | yes |
| tabs | no | no | no | yes |

## the endgame

we don't need to beat cursor's $4m ARR. we need to own the "minimalist ai ide" category so completely that when someone googles it, they find us. 

when cursor adds their 500th feature and windsurf promises their 50th workflow improvement, we'll still be here: 50mb, black background, just claude.

that's how we win.
