# yurucode: Path to Anthropic Acquisition

## Context: Why This Matters

### Anthropic's First Acquisition: Bun (December 2025)

> "Anthropic acquired Bun, which helps developers run and manage code more effectively, as the Claude maker looks to boost the speed and stability of its coding agent."
> — US News, December 2025

**Why Bun?**
- Powers Claude Code infrastructure
- Speed and reliability focus
- Essential to developer experience
- Technical excellence

**Claude Code Revenue**: $1 billion annualized (as of late 2025)

### What Anthropic Needs

1. **Best-in-class developer experience** for Claude Code
2. **Cross-platform native clients** (desktop, mobile)
3. **UI that showcases Claude's capabilities**
4. **Speed infrastructure** (they acquired Bun for this)

### yurucode's Opportunity

Position yurucode as the **official GUI for Claude Code**:
- Native Tauri app (fastest possible)

## Final Note

The goal isn't just acquisition - it's building the **best possible Claude Code experience**.

If we do that, acquisition becomes a natural outcome.

**Build for users. Acquisition follows.**
